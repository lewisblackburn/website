In my free time, I'm usually meddling in web development, crafting new blog posts, or rowing. I'm currenlty trying to become fluent in Swedish. A fun fact about me is that my favourite TV shows are the ones that tell you when to laugh!

Apart from being a full-time comedian, I'm creating an entertainment database app in my freetime. It aims to be a user-maintained place to share films, shows, books, music and people.

You can contact me by email at hello at lewisblackburn.me to say hi! I always appreciate meeting new people.

This site has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. The motiviation for this site is to have a space for my projects and posts to share what i've learned.
