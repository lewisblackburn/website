## 1. Overview

Metabase is a comprehensive database that brings together metadata for films, TV shows, books, people, songs, and more.
It combines features from platforms like TMDB, IMDb, and Goodreads to offer users a unified space to explore, create, and
update their favorite media. What sets Metabase apart, however, is its focus on **cross-media relationships**, such as linking
films to their soundtracks or connecting people to their related works. Additionally, the platform offers **personalized recommendations**
and **community-driven reviews**, enhancing the overall user experience.

## 2. The Vision

Creating Metabase stemmed from my frequent need to identify which film a song I was listening to was from, as well as the inconvenience
of using multiple platforms to track and log my media. Unlike many existing services, Metabase aims to offer:

- A cross-media database in which users can explore multiple types of media in one place.
- Seamless, personalised recommendations that are based on a user's full range of interests (books, films, music).
- A collaborative community-driven space where users contribute to building the media database and be able to track their additions.

## 3. The Tech Stack

Building Metabase required making some key decisions about the tech stack. We selected tools
that would be both scalable and flexible enough to handle large volumes of media data while
minimising reliance on third-party services.

### Backend

- Fly app deployment with Docker
- Multi-region, distributed, production-ready SQLite Database with LiteFS
- Healthcheck endpoint for Fly backups region fallbacks
- GitHub Actions with testing and deploy on merge for both production and staging environments
- Email/Password Authentication with cookie-based sessions
- Transaction email with Resend and forgot password/password reset support
- Database ORM with Prisma
- Role-based User Permissions
- Custom built image hosting + AWS S3
- Caching via cachified: Both in-memory and SQLite-based (with better-sqlite3)
- Local third-party request mocking with MSW
- Unit testing with Vitest and Testing Library with pre-configured Test Database
- Code formatting with Prettier
- Linting with ESLint
- Static Types with TypeScript
- Runtime schema validation with zod

### Frontend

- Remix as the Web Framework of choice
- Progressively Enhanced and fully type safe forms with Conform
- Styling with Tailwind
- An excellent, customizable component library with Radix UI
- End-to-end testing with Playwright

## 4. Design Process

### User Interface (UI)

It was imperative that our user interface was **intuitive** and \*\*aesthetically pleasing\*\*. Drawing inspiration
from current popular platforms such as IMDb and TMDB, on the go we built a clean, modern interface, but
aimed to make it more user-centered, with features like an easy-to-navigate media library and custom
dashboards.

#### Key UI Considerations:

- Diverse but simple **accessible navigation** for both power and casual users.
- **Personalized recommendations** front and center, tailored to each userâ€™s media consumption habits.
- **Clear and concise information** about media entries without overwhelming the user.

### UX Research

Before finalising the design, we conducted in-person **user surveys** and **interviews** with potential users to understand
their pain points with existing platforms and what possible features they might like.

Some of the insights we gathered:

- Users wanted an easier way to navigate between different types of media.
- Personalisation of the dashboard was a common need amongst users.
- Mobile functionality was a necessary requirement.

## 5. Development Challenges

Developing a comprehensive platform like Metabase turned out to be a lot more troublesome than first
anticipated. It required solving some **technological and design challenges** along the way:

### Recommendation System

One of the biggest challenges was integrating personalised recommendations across different media types.
There were many ways to implement a recommendation system which lead to analysis paralysis of which would
be most suitable.

**Solution**: Initially, we implemented a **collaborative filtering** algorithm and incorporated **content-based
filtering** to offer hybrid recommendations. However, this was not enough. The recommender would be able
to recommend similar films based on title's and geners which is great for reocmmending films in a
series e.g. Transformers. But, it couldn't provide recommendations personalised to each user. In the future,
to improve this, we are going to implement an external server to run a reinforcement learning (AI) recommendation system.

```ts title="recommendations.server.ts"
export async function generateFilmRecommendations(updatedOrCreatedFilmFromDate: Date) {
  const existingFilms = await prisma.film.findMany({
    select: {
      id: true,
      runtime: true,
      title: true,
      overview: true,
      tagline: true,
      genres: {
        select: {
          name: true,
        },
      },
      keywords: {
        select: {
          name: true,
        },
      },
      cast: {
        select: {
          person: {
            select: {
              name: true,
            },
          },
          character: true,
        },
      },
      createdAt: true,
      updatedAt: true,
    },
  })

  // NOTE: Finds updated films within the last {time period} provided.
  const updatedOrNewFilms = existingFilms.filter((film) => {
    return film.createdAt >= updatedOrCreatedFilmFromDate || film.updatedAt >= updatedOrCreatedFilmFromDate
  })

  for (const updatedOrNewFilm of updatedOrNewFilms) {
    const recommendedFilms = existingFilms
      .map((existingFilm) => ({
        ...existingFilm,
        similarity: calculateFilmSimilarity(updatedOrNewFilm, existingFilm),
      }))
      .filter((film) => film.id !== updatedOrNewFilm.id) // Exclude the input film
      .sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity) // Sort in descending order
      .slice(0, 5) // Only keep the top 5 most similar films

    // NOTE: This operation is ignored in middleware, so it won't
    // trigger an infinite loop as the updatedAt field is not updated.
    // If it was updated, it would trigger the recommendations again.
    // This is the same for the next await prisma.film.update too.
    await prisma.film.update({
      where: { id: updatedOrNewFilm.id },
      data: {
        recommendations: {
          // Delete previous recommended films
          deleteMany: {},
          create: recommendedFilms.map((film) => ({
            film: {
              connect: {
                id: film.id,
              },
            },
            similarity: film.similarity,
          })),
        },
      },
    })
    console.log('Updated recommendations for film', updatedOrNewFilm.id)

    for (const recommendedFilm of recommendedFilms) {
      const recommendedRecommendedFilms = existingFilms
        .map((existingFilm) => ({
          ...existingFilm,
          similarity: calculateFilmSimilarity(recommendedFilm, existingFilm),
        }))
        .filter((film) => film.id !== recommendedFilm.id) // Exclude the input film
        .sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity) // Sort in descending order
        .slice(0, 5) // Only keep the top 5 most similar films

      console.log('Updated recommendations for film', recommendedFilm.id)

      await prisma.film.update({
        where: { id: recommendedFilm.id },
        data: {
          recommendations: {
            // Delete previous recommended films
            deleteMany: {},
            create: recommendedRecommendedFilms.map((film) => ({
              film: {
                connect: {
                  id: film.id,
                },
              },
              similarity: film.similarity,
            })),
          },
        },
      })
    }
  }
}
```

1. **Retrieve existing films**:

   - Fetch all films from the database along with selected fields like title, genres, cast, and timestamps.

2. **Filter for updated/new films**:

   - Filter the films that were either created or updated after the provided `updatedOrCreatedFilmFromDate`.

3. **For each updated or new film**:

   - Loop over the filtered films.

4. **Calculate similarity for the current film**:

   - For each updated/new film, compute its similarity with every other film in the database using `calculateFilmSimilarity`.

5. **Exclude the current film**:

   - Remove the current film from its own recommendations and sort other films by similarity.

6. **Select the top 5 similar films**:

   - Select the top 5 films with the highest similarity scores.

7. **Update the film's recommendations**:

   - Clear the existing recommendations for the current film and store the new top 5 recommendations along with their similarity scores in the database.

8. **For each recommended film**:

   - Loop over the top 5 recommended films of the current film.

9. **Recompute recommendations for each recommended film**:

   - For each recommended film, recompute the similarity between it and all other films (excluding itself).

10. **Update the recommended film's recommendations**:

- Similar to step 7, clear and update the recommended films' top 5 recommendations based on the recalculated similarities.

This recursive process ensures both the updated films and their recommended films are updated in tandem.

### Audit Logs

Finding a way to implement a simple audit log system which could be used as middleware in transactions
to store changes made to models.

**Solution**: Please read the in-depth article I wrote about this [**here**](/blog/prisma-dynamic-context-and-audit-logs).

### Importing Media

In order to have a smooth transition from other platforms, I wanted to be able to import media from them.

**Solution**: Using object-oriented programming create an API wrapper for each platform and build UI components
e.g. import tables to import the media.

<Image alt='Dynamic Import Table' src='/images/projects/metabase/import-table.png' width={1920} height={1080} />

### User-Generated Content Moderation

To maintain quality and trust, moderating reviews and ratings was critical.

**Solution**: We built an admin dashboard with moderation tools to filter out spammy or inappropriate content.

## 6. Key Features

Metabase stands out for its wide range of features, designed to engage users while simplifying their media exploration journey.

### 1. Search and Recommendations

Metabase's search algorithm delivers fast and accurate results. Users can filter by media type, genre, rating, and so much more, making it easier to find exactly what theyâ€™re looking for.

### 2. User Reviews and Ratings

Metabase fosters a community-driven space where users contribute their opinions. A rich review system allows users to leave detailed ratings, and community-driven algorithms push the most helpful reviews to the top.

### 3. Cross-Media Connections

One of Metabaseâ€™s unique features is its ability to connect different types of media (e.g., linking a film to its soundtrack or a book itâ€™s based on).

### 4. Watchlists and Favorites

Users can easily organise their media through custom watchlists and favorite lists, which are stored and synced across devices.

## 7. Performance Optimisation

Optimising the performance of a media-heavy platform like Metabase required special attention to ensure fast load times and smooth user experience.

### Caching Mechanisms

To improve response times, we implemented both server-side caching and client-side caching for commonly used data, especially the media catalog and user profiles.

## 8. Future Roadmap

Metabase is constantly evolving. Some of the features and improvements we plan to implement include:

- **Social Sharing**: Allow users to share their watchlists and reviews on social media platforms.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: More granular controls for users to fine-tune their recommendations.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a native mobile app to make accessing Metabase on-the-go easier.

## 9. Lessons Learned

Building Metabase taught us several valuable lessons:

- **Scalability is key**: Early decisions on the tech stack can save a lot of pain later.
- **User feedback is invaluable**: Iterating based on real user input ensured we were building features people actually wanted.
- **Data can be tricky**: Aggregating data from multiple sources is a double-edged sword â€” it adds depth but also complexity.
